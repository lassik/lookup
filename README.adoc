= lookup

Lookup facts quickly from the command line. Databases are just `.csv`
(comma-separated value) files in `~/.lookup` so it's easy to make your
own.

It's also easy to share tables with friends or communities -- you can
clone Git repositories into `~/.lookup`. Lookup ignores everything
except `.csv` files so it's no problem to have the generator scripts
for computer-generated tables in the same place. You can also use
symbolic links in `~/.lookup` if you want to store tables elsewhere.
